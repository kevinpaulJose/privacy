      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Your privacy is important to us. It is

        We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a
        service to you. We collect it by fair and lawful means, with your
        knowledge and consent. We also let you know why we’re collecting it and
        how it will be used.
      </p>

        We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide
        you with your requested service. What data we store, we’ll protect

        as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.

        We don’t share any personally identifying information publicly or with
        third-parties, except when required to by law.

      <h2>More Information</h2>
      <p>
        Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously
        mentioned if there is something that you aren't sure whether you need or
        not it's usually safer to leave cookies enabled in case it does interact
        with one of the features you use on our site.
